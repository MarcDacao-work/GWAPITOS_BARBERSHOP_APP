Get haircut → Barbers marks "Complete"

Pay via app (toggle) → Done

Barber Flow:
Sign up → Choose "Barber"

View dashboard → Today's appointments

Scan customer QR code OR manually check them in

Use Control Panel to manage queue:

"Call Next" → Notifies customer

"Complete" → Moves to payment

"Break" → Pauses queue

View queue display (simulated IoT screen)

Mark payment received

🎯 CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO BUILD
Day 1 Components:
AuthScreen - Signup/Login

HomeScreen - Role-based landing

BookAppointmentScreen - Booking flow

BarberDashboard - Basic appointment list

AppointmentConfirmation - Shows QR code

Day 2 Components:
QRScannerScreen - Barber scans QR

QueueDisplayScreen - Public queue view

BarberControlPanel - IoT simulation buttons

CustomerQueueScreen - Customer's queue status

PaymentScreen - Simple payment toggle

⚡ PRO TIPS FOR 2-DAY RUSH
Cut Corners Here:
Skip email verification

Use mock barber data if needed

Simple UI (no animations)

No actual payment gateway (just toggle)

Skip "Forgot Password" (add placeholder)

Must-Have Features:
QR code generation & scanning

Real-time queue updates

Role-based navigation

Basic appointment CRUD

Simulated IoT control panel

Nice-to-Have (If Time):
Push notifications

Sound effects for IoT buttons

Estimated wait time calculator

Multiple barber stations

📱 SCREEN FLOW ARCHITECTURE
text
Auth Stack:
  Login → Signup → Create Profile

Customer Tab Navigator:
  Home → Book → My Appointments → Queue Status

Barber Tab Navigator:
  Dashboard → Scan QR → Control Panel → Queue Display

Shared:
  QR Scanner (modal)
  Payment Screen
🚨 TIME MANAGEMENT WARNINGS
Day 1 Risk: Authentication takes longer than expected

Solution: Use Supabase Magic Links or skip signup for demo

Day 2 Risk: QR scanner permissions/issues

Solution: Have manual check-in as backup

Biggest Risk: Real-time queue sync complexity

Solution: Use simple polling if realtime fails

✅ SUCCESS METRICS FOR 2 DAYS
By end of Day 2, you should have:

✅ Customer can book & get QR code

✅ Barber can scan QR & check in customer

✅ Queue updates in real-time

✅ Barber can mark haircut complete

✅ Customer can "pay"

✅ Simulated IoT control panel works

✅ Basic queue display visible

🆘 EMERGENCY PLAN
If running out of time:

Drop payment feature

Skip multiple barber stations

Use simple list instead of real-time queue

Hardcode QR data instead of generating

---
### ✅ Achievements Today (quick summary)

- 🔧 Core Booking UI: Implemented the full customer booking flow UI — `BookAppointmentScreen.js` (select barber, service, date, time) and confirmation navigation.
- 🆗 Appointment Confirmation + QR: Confirmation screen generates and displays a QR code, includes share and instructions (`AppointmentConfirmationScreen.js` — uses `react-native-qrcode-svg`).
- 🧾 Payment Mock: Payment screen with "Mark as Paid" toggle, receipt mock and payment actions (`PaymentScreen.js`).
- 🎛 Barber Control Panel: Interactive control panel with Call Next / Complete / Break / Emergency / Add Walk-in and local queue management (`BarberControlPanel.js`).
- 📺 Queue Display (IoT simulation): Public-facing display that shows Now Serving / Next Up and auto-refresh behavior (`QueueDisplayScreen.js`).
- ⚙️ Supabase client: Supabase client file exists and is ready to be used for persistence (`src/services/supabase.js`).
- 📱 QR Scanner (scaffold): `QRScannerScreen.js` scaffolded as placeholder — ready to integrate `expo-barcode-scanner` for scanning and validation.

Short note: Most features are implemented as UI and local/mock-data flows (see `src/utils/mockData.js`). To go fully live you should integrate Supabase for persistence and realtime updates.

### Day 2 Items — Current Status

- QR Code Implementation: ✅ Done — QR is generated in confirmation screen and is shareable.
- QR Scanner for Barbers: 🟡 Partially done — scanner screen exists; needs `expo-barcode-scanner` integration and validation logic.
- Queue Management: ✅ UI implemented with mock queue; needs backend sync (Supabase) for realtime.
- Barber Control Panel: ✅ Done (UI + local queue logic).
- Queue Display Screen: ✅ Done (auto-refresh local demo).
- IoT Control Panel (simulated): ✅ Done via Barber Control Panel interactions.
- Notifications & Payment Toggle: 🟡 Partially done — payment UI exists; push notifications not implemented.

### Next Small Polishing Tasks (recommended)

- Integrate `expo-barcode-scanner` in `QRScannerScreen.js` and validate scanned QR against appointment IDs.
- Hook booking & appointments to Supabase (`src/services/supabase.js`) to persist data and enable realtime queue updates.
- Replace mock queue (`src/utils/mockData.js`) with live queries and Supabase Realtime subscriptions or lightweight polling.
- Add UX polish: success toasts, network error handling, and guard rails for empty selections.
